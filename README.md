The app is designed to provide an engaging and interactive platform for students to learn about the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It begins with a secure and intuitive login page, which allows users to personalize their experience. After logging in, users are directed to the homepage, the main navigation hub where they can access all learning resources and features related to the SDGs.

The homepage is designed with simplicity in mind, featuring three key icons at the bottom for easy access to the core functionalities:

1. Profile: The profile section displays each user’s profile picture along with their score, which reflects their progress and achievements within the app. Users can monitor their engagement and performance, motivating them to continue learning and participating.


2. Leaderboard: To foster healthy competition and community engagement, the app features a leaderboard where students can see how their scores compare with those of their peers. This competitive aspect encourages continued participation and goal-oriented learning.


3. Quizzes and Videos: To further enhance learning, the app offers quizzes and videos on each SDG.

The quizzes are designed to test the users’ understanding of each goal. Scoring well in quizzes helps boost their overall score, which is reflected on their profile and in the leaderboard.

The videos provide visual and interactive content that explains the SDGs in detail. These videos include real-world examples, animations, and expert insights, making the learning experience richer and more engaging.




Together, these features make the app a comprehensive educational tool. The combination of interactive content like quizzes and videos with gamified elements such as scoring and leaderboards keeps students motivated while improving their knowledge of the SDGs. This ensures a dynamic and impactful learning journey aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of global sustainability efforts.
